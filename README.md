## Technologies Used

### Front - End
- **HTML**: Used to structure the web page, including the header, main content area, and footer. It provides the basic framework for the application.
- **CSS**: Responsible for styling the application. It creates the Rick and Morty - themed look, including the background, color scheme, and layout of elements such as headers, articles, and buttons. CSS also ensures the application is responsive on different screen sizes.
- **JavaScript**: Used for interacting with the Rick and Morty API. It fetches character data and dynamically populates the web page with character information. JavaScript also handles the functionality of the README dropdown and the click - outside - to - close feature.
- **Font Awesome**: A library used to add icons to the application, such as social media icons and the logout icon.

### Server - Side (if applicable)
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: A templating engine that allows embedding JavaScript code within HTML files. It is used to conditionally render elements based on the user's login status, such as the welcome message and the logout button.
